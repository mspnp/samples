This sample deploys Azure virtual networks in a hub and spoke configuration. An Azure Firewall and Bastion host are also deployed. Optionally, a VPN gateway and sample workload (virtual machines) can be deployed. 

Where applicable, each resource is configured to send diagnostics to an Azure Log Analytics instance.

## Deploy sample

Create a resource group for the deployment.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name hub-spoke --location eastus
```

**Basic deployment**

Run the following command to initiate the deployment. If you would like to also deploy this sample with virtual machines and / or an Azure VPN gateway, see the `az deployment group create` examples found later in this document.

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create \
    --resource-group hub-spoke \
    --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mspnp/samples/master/solutions/azure-hub-spoke/azuredeploy.json
```

**Deploy with virtual machines**

Run the following command to initiate the deployment with a Linux VM deployed to the first spoke network.

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create \
    --resource-group hub-spoke \
    --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mspnp/samples/master/solutions/azure-hub-spoke/azuredeploy.json \
    --parameters adminPassword=Password2020! linuxVMCount=1 windowsVMCount=1
```

**Deploy with VPN gateway**

Run the following command to initiate the deployment with a Linux VM deployed to the first spoke network and a virtual network gateway deployed into the hub virtual network.

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create \
    --resource-group hub-spoke \
    --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mspnp/samples/master/solutions/azure-hub-spoke/azuredeploy.json \
    --parameters adminPassword=Password2020! linuxVMCount=1 windowsVMCount=1 deployVpnGateway=true
```

## Diagnostic configurations

The following resources are configured to send diagnostic logs to the included Log Analytics workspace.

- All virtual networks
- All network security groups
- Azure VPN Gateway
- Azure Firewall
- Azure Bastion

Note, this deployment includes optional virtual machines. These are not configured with a Log Analytics workspace, however, can be with the Log Analytics virtual machine extension for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/oms-windows) and [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/oms-linux).
